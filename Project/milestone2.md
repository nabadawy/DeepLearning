# Project Milestone 2

At this point, **you are expected to fully have implemented your proposed solution**. You are required to make a presentation containing the following requirements.

## The Presentation Requirements

1. Problem Statement.
2. Original model from literature.
3. Your proposed updates/solution. Point out exactly all the differences between your solution/updates and the original model.
4. All the progress done. **Highlight the progress during this milestone.**
5. Plots and graphs that show your results and the evaluation difference between the original model and your solution/updates.
6. Next steps and timeline until the final delivery.
7. Each team member's contribution. You should state only the contribution to the technical work, so designing the presentation for example shouldn't be included. "We divided the work equally" is not accepted; have a clear division of work.

## Deliverables

1. Presentation slides containing the requirements.
2. A recorded video of your presentation.

## Selected Presentations

1. [Moving Object Detection](assets/selected_ms2_presentations/moving_object.pdf)

6. [Artistic Style Transfer For Videos](assets/selected_ms2_presentations/style_transfer.pdf)
7. [Floor Localization](assets/selected_ms2_presentations/localization.pdf)
8. [Text to Image](assets/selected_ms2_presentations/txt2img.pdf)
9. [Facial Expression Evaluation](assets/selected_ms2_presentations/facial_expression.pdf)

## Notes

1. At this step your grading will be based on your work, effort, and quality of submissions.
2. The purpose of the results is to show how deeply you understand the problem, its limitations, challenges, and how your solution/updates affect the accuracy (either negatively or positively).
3. **There is no live presentation for this milestone**.
4. The recorded video of the presentation should not exceed **seven minutes** and should be at least **five minutes**.
5. The instructors _might_ ask you to make a few updates to be delivered in the final delivery.
6. The provided selected presentations might have been made under different requirements, just because any of them doesn't meet any of our requirements doesn't give you the ability to do the same.
