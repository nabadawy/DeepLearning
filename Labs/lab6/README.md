![Cartpole with Reinforcement Learning](cartpole-rl.png)

## 1 - Objectives

* Building deep reinforcement learning models.
* Working with games simulation.

## 2 - Requirements

* Solve [this notebook](lab6.ipynb) of the assignment and deliver a filled ipython notebook that shows the best output found in your experiments. **Check the hints in the notebook to help guide you while filling in the code**.
* Any detected cheating or copying of the required code (_either from online sources or from your colleagues_) will be **severely punished**.
* Download the notebook and upload it for submission. **Make sure you include the output of each of the cells, especially the videos and the plots. This is a clear indication that you filled the code correctly. Failing to include the videos and the rewards plots will lead to a reduction in the grades. Also, download the produced video and deliver it beside the notebook in the submission form.**
* No report is required.
