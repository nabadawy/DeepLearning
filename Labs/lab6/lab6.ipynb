        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",

        "1.   In many cases, games have perfectly describable environments. For example, all rules of chess can be formally written and programmed into a chess game simulator;\n",
        "2.   Games are massively parallelizable. Since they do not require running in the real world, simultaneous environments can be run on large data clusters;\n",
        "3.   Simpler scenarios in games enable fast prototyping. This speeds up the development of algorithms that could eventually run in the real-world; and\n",

To access the Cartpole environment, we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`, which we gained access to when we imported the `gym` package.

Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time."

Since we (and the agent) is uncertain about if and when the game or task will end (i.e., when the pole will fall), it is useful to emphasize getting rewards **now** rather than later in the future -- this is the idea of discounting. This is a similar concept to discounting money in the case of interest. ecall from lecture, we use reward discount to give more preference at getting rewards now rather than later in the future.

In this assignment, we will focus on *policy gradient* methods which aim to **maximize** the likelihood of actions that result in large rewards. Equivalently, this means that we want to **minimize** the negative likelihood of these same actions. We achieve this by simply **scaling** (aka multiplying) the probabilities by their associated rewards -- effectively amplifying the likelihood of actions that result in large rewards.\n",

Recall that we can easily compute the negative log-likelihood of a discrete action by evaluting its [softmax cross entropy](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits). Like in supervised learning, we can use stochastic gradient descent methods to achieve the desired minimization.\n",
