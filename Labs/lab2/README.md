## 1 - Objectives

* Building a model for multinominal classification task.
* Understanding the effect of using CNNs in models.
* Having a look at machine learning interpretability using [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overviews.html).

## 2 - MNIST Dataset

The MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.

You can have a look at [the dataset on the CSV format on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv), you can check the notebooks and ideas applied on it on Kaggle.

Also, the dataset is [builtin in keras](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/) and you can download & load it directly using one code line.

## 3 - Requirements
* **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Please have a look at the report template (included with the assignment instructions) first to keep in mind what questions and experiments are required. **Make sure you read the instructions in the report template carefully before going through the ipython notebook**. Having a look at the report template first helps you avoid getting stuck when filling out the report.
* Solve [this notebook](lab2.ipynb) of the assignment and deliver a filled ipython notebook that **shows the best output found in your experiments**. **Do not clear the best output from the cells**.
* You should fill the provided report template based on all the experiments and work you made and deliver it with the notebooks. **Make sure to answer all the questions and fill in all the TODOs in the report to avoid losing grades.**
