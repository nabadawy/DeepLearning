# Assignment 3: Convolutional Neural Network Use Cases

![CNN Architectures](cnn_architectures.png)

## 1 - Objectives

1. Building a custom CNN model for a classification task.
2. Using some CNNs case studies (VGG, ResNet & Other use cases).
3. Use transfer learning on the CNNs case studies.
4. Use layers freezing with transfer learning.

## 2 - Happy House Dataset

The dataset is used for emotion classification (two classes, either happy or not). The dataset consists of images and labels as shawn in the following figure, in which class 1 is happy and class 0 is not.

This dataset can be used to solve the Happy House problem. Where, we allow a person to enter the house only if he/she is smiling! So, a smile detector!

The train set has 600 examples.

The test set has 150 examples.

You can find [the dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/happy-house-dataset), also you can fine many [code notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/happy-house-dataset/code) for the dataset on Kaggle.

## 3 - Requirements
* **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Please have a look at the report template (included with the assignment instructions) first to keep in mind what questions and experiments are required. **Make sure you read the instructions in the report template carefully before going through the ipython notebook**. Having a look at the report template first helps you avoid getting stuck when filling out the report.
* Solve [this notebook](Lab3.ipynb) of the assignment and deliver a filled ipython notebook that **shows the best output found in your experiments in this part**. **Do not clear the best output from the cells.**
* You should fill the provided report template based on all the experiments and work you made and deliver it as a PDF with the notebook. **Make sure to answer all the questions and fill in all the TODOs in the report to avoid losing grades.**
